Metro ticket booking the basic aim of the web-application is to reduce the time people take to stand in the line and buy tickets for the
metro. Our application will help them book the ticket on-line prior to going to the station for the journey. Our customers will be able to
see the train schedules prior to book their ticket and also see the time slot allotted to the train to travel from different locations.
They  will also be able to check the fare of their travel. Also, they can book tickets for max 5 people (ppl). Thereafter the customer may
proceed to save their transaction and checkout to payment. The customer may also login at a later time and check his saved history.
